# stylus-extension-themes

A few themes to stylize **Stylus Extension** itself becuase it makes sense to have themes within extension windows and popdowns. Nothing worse than using a dark theme and having a popup that is blinding white!  I highly recommend Midnight Lizard to control the look and feel of websites. It is an amazing extension, best one I've used of its kind. Be sure to show the dev some appreciation, the extension is obiously a work of love. For slyizing elements that Midnight Lizard misses use Stylus.
