# stylus-extension-themes
A few themes to stylize Stylus Extension itself - makes sense to have themes within extension windows and popdowns.  I highly recommend Midnight Lizard to control the look and feel of websites. For elements that Midnight Lizard misses use Stylus.  Feel free to fork - License MIT - If you appreciate the work donations appreciated :)
